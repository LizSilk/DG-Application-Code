comment the code -done
add libraries to repository
work out how to package & run this w/o pycharm
test if ICP lookup fails safe - done
write some unit tests? - done
add logging to the server so we can see how much use it gets - seems this is done automatically


other notes;

The javascript currently assumes the url of the server is the same as the url of the website - this will need to be
changed when this is put in production

send_request.js has run before as it declares the iframe variable icp_request.js
set the height of the iframe container to avoid the cutting off issue
